# dials_shortest_path
An implementation of Dial's shortest path algorithm

A description of the algorithm cn be found on my [website](http://emmanueljohn.me)

**Running the program**

    python spsolve.py --infile input_file --output outfile

    or

    python spsolve.py

    To use stdin and stdout

**Input format**

Input is in DIMACS format and can be generated with [netgen](http://github.com/emmanuj/netgen).

DIMACS format is line-oriented. The type of record a line contains is
indicated by the character in position 1.

* A c indicates a comment line.
* There is one record with type p. This record tells the problem type
(for shortest-path problems, this field is always min), the number n of
nodes and the number m of arcs.
* There is a record of type n for each node with nonzero supply or demand. For shortest-path problems, the origin node should have a supply of n − 1 and each non-source node should have supply −1. The nodes generated by the netgen problem generator are indexed from 1 to n but the solver translates them to be 0 indexed.

**Output**

The output is in DIMACS format, with f records for all arcs, including
tail and head node numbers and a flow equal to the number of paths in the
shortest path tree that contain that arc, and an s record with the total cost
of the solution, computed as the sum of arc weights times the number of
shortest paths containing.each arc.
Node numbers are translated back to the range 1–n.
